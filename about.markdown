I'm Ognjen, and I'm a researcher at [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org), where I work on designing and formally verifying various aspects of the platform.
I've worked on message routing, the consensus protocol, the smart contracts controlling the system and its tokens, but also on the developer tooling.
I get to spend a fair chunk of time formally modeling various parts of these components using TLA+.

Previously, I worked at [Digital Asset](https://digitalasset.com) on designing and implementing [Canton](https://canton.io), a distributed database where data is distributed over mutually distrusting parties, completed my PhD on formal verification of fault tolerant systems at ETH Zurich, and in the older times still did many odd and less odd software contracting jobs.
